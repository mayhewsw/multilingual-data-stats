# mC4 Token Counts

This was the data used to train [mT5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11934). These numbers came from Table 5 in the mT5 paper.

"Tokens" refers to tokens produced by the [released SentencePiece model](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/t5-data/vocabs/mc4.250000.100extra?pageState=(%22StorageObjectListTable%22:(%22f%22:%22%255B%255D%22))&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false).
This data can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4#c4multilingual). I have not validated the data
sizes against the table.
