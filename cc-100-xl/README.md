# CC-100-XL

This data comes from CC-100-XL, first introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10668). There are 115 different "languages" represented in the table, although 6 of these are romanized versions of a language (e.g. Hindi Romanized). The dataset was created in a similar fashion as [CC-100](../cc-100) (see Section 2.1), and used Common Crawl snapshots from Summer 2013 to March/April 2020.
