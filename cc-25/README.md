# CC-25 Dataset

This is the dataset used to train mBART. These numbers come from Table 1
of the [mBART paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08210.pdf). It' s not clear how many 
Common Crawl snapshots were used, nor which time period they came from.

I've included a column of Bytes/token just for a sanity check. Notice that the values for Japanese and Chinese
are ridiculously high. From the paper: "Chinese and Japanese corpus are not segmented, so the
tokens counts here are sentences counts."
