# CC-25 Dataset

This is the dataset used to train mBART. These numbers come from Table 1
of the [mBART paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08210.pdf). The data was created using
CommonCrawl snapshots from January-December 2018. I've included a column of
Byte/token just for a sanity check. Notice that the values for Japanese and Chinese
are ridiculously high. From the paper: "Chinese and Japanese corpus are not segmented, so the
tokens counts here are sentences counts."
